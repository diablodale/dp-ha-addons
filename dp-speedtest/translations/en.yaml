  server_id:

    description: >-
      Leave blank for automatic server selection (recommended), or enter the

      How often to run the speedtest in minutes. Default is 1440 minutes (24 hours).

  static_results:
    name: JSON Test Results
    description: >-
      JSON test results for debugging instead of running an actual test.
      When enabled, the add-on will use this static JSON rather than producing
      JSON from a real speedtest. This is useful for testing the add-on's
      functionality without consuming bandwidth or when troubleshooting issues.
      Must be valid Speedtest CLI JSON output format.

  log_level:
    name: Log Level
    description: >-
      Controls the verbosity of log output. Lower levels like 'trace' and 'debug'
      provide more detailed information useful for troubleshooting, while higher levels
      like 'warning' and 'error' only show important messages. Default level is 'warning'.
